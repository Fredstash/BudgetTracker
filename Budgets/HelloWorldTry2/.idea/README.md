# Overview

I wanted to understand Java and so I felt like this would help me use many aspects of Java. I started with some basic functions and classes. After grasping functions and classes I studied the functionality of the Java collection ArrayList and recreated it to implement in my software

My software is a budget tracking app. It allows the user to input data into an ArrayList. They can store budget information, including the expense type, the current money spent, and the goal. The software also allows for the user to delete budget data. The software also allows the user to add money into the current money spent to any of the expense types.

My primary purpose was to understand data structures in Java by implementing a homemade data structure to store budget data.

# Development Environment

* I primarily used Intellij for the development
* This was all coded in Java
* I used the scanner library

# Useful Websites

* [ArrayList Example devgenius](https://blog.devgenius.io/creating-the-java-arraylist-data-structure-3df0b18ad43b) - I Used this for the basic setup of data structures.

# Future Work

* Take the current date and give a suggestion on how they can meet their budget.
* Save the budget in a file.
* Build a nicer looking interface
